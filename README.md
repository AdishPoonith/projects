📄 Project Showcase — Bachelor of Data Science (3-Year Course)

Welcome to my portfolio repository!
This repository showcases the projects and solutions I developed during my 3-year Bachelor of Data Science degree. Throughout the program, I focused on building a strong foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, big data processing, web development, blockchain systems, and advanced image classification models.

📊 1. Statistical Analysis Projects

Conducted hypothesis testing, regression analysis, multivariate analysis (e.g., Hotelling’s T², Mahalanobis Distance).
Applied SAS and R for professional-grade statistical modeling.
Projects included:
Psychological trait analysis for emergency health workers.
Clinical trial data analysis for pharmaceutical studies.
WBC (White Blood Cell) feature comparison between healthy and diseased groups.
🤖 2. Machine Learning Modeling

Built and deployed classification, regression, and clustering models.
Tools: Python (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), Vertex AI (Google Cloud).
Example projects:
Disease prediction models (Conjunctivitis, Eczema) using health datasets.
Predictive modeling for taxi trip fare analysis using Hadoop + MapReduce.
Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, F1 score).
📈 3. Data Science Projects

End-to-end data science pipelines: data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, deployment.
Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL.
Highlight:
Built a full open data storytelling dashboard in R (Shiny app) analyzing public datasets.
Performed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and cluster analysis for dimensionality reduction and insights discovery.
🛢️ 4. Big Data Processing

Worked with Hadoop and Spark ecosystems.
Key skills:
Data ingestion into HDFS.
MapReduce programming (in-mapper combining, multi-reducer operations).
Processing large-scale taxi trip datasets into categorized analytics (short, medium, long trips).
🌐 5. Web Development

Designed and deployed full-stack applications.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Backend: Flask (Python).
Notable projects:
Movie subscription platform (subscription tracking, free movie unlocks).
Interactive dashboards for healthcare analytics.
🔗 6. Blockchain System Design

Explored decentralized technologies.
Project:
Designed a conceptual blockchain system for secure health record sharing.
Focused on smart contracts (Ethereum Solidity basics) and transaction validation.
🖼️ 7. Machine Learning for Image Classification

Built ML pipelines for image data analysis.
Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, Vertex AI.
Projects:
White Blood Cell (WBC) image classification.
Food image labeling and automatic classification using Google's Gemini model.
Focused on:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Data augmentation and transfer learning for small datasets.
📚 Technologies & Tools Mastered

Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
Libraries & Frameworks: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Flask, Hadoop MapReduce, Spark.
Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud (Vertex AI).
Statistical Tools: SAS, RStudio.
Blockchain: Ethereum concepts, Smart Contracts.
🚀 Summary

This repository serves as a culmination of my diverse, multidisciplinary learning journey, integrating advanced data science, machine learning, big data, blockchain, and web development skills.
It reflects my readiness to tackle real-world data-driven challenges across industries.
